# Shouhei Yamauchiâ€™s Portfolio

## Portfolio Contents/Layout
I listed down all the items which were to be included in my website which I needed to know before I proceeded onto planning what I wanted the layout to look like. The basic items to be included were to be as follows:
-	Short introduction of myself
-	Education history
-	Employment history
-	Skills as a developer
-	Projects
-	Contact form
Designing the actual layout was a challenging process as I had limited experience with designing a whole website by myself. It was very helpful to browse through other developers' portfolios and other websites providing free layouts such as www.startbootstrap.com.

Once I decided the overall layout, I moved onto selecting the colour scheme. There were plenty of resources on the internet which provided a good basis for me to select a colour scheme I liked. I chose orange, grey and white which I thought looked fresh and clean.

## Images/Multimedia
www.unsplash.com was a good website providing free to use images. I chose an image which fitted the colour scheme.

I used www.flaticon.com and www.devicon.fr for my icons. The TTYGIF gem allowed me to create a gif for one of my terminal apps included in the profile section.
