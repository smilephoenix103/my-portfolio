Personal portfolio website built for CFA Major Project #1.

## Design Process

### Portfolio Contents
I listed out all the items to be included on my portfolio website before I proceeded onto planning out the layout:
-	Short introduction
-	Education history
-	Employment history
-	Skills as a developer
-	Projects
-	Contact form

### Layout Design
Designing the layout was quite a challenging process as I had limited experience with designing a whole website by myself. It was very helpful to browse through other developers' portfolios and other websites providing free layouts such as www.startbootstrap.com for inspiration.

Once I decided the overall layout, I moved onto selecting the colour scheme. There were plenty of resources on the internet which provided a good basis for me to select a colour scheme I liked. I chose orange, grey and white which I thought looked fresh and clean.

### Images/Multimedia
www.unsplash.com was a good website providing free to use images. I chose an image which fitted the colour scheme.

I used www.flaticon.com and www.devicon.fr for my icons.
